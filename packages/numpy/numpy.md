# Numpy
Numpy is the fundamental library of Python, used to perform scientific computing. It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and tools to deal with them. 

A Numpy array is a grid of values (of the same type) that are indexed by a tuple of positive integers, Numpy arrays are fast, easy to understand, and give users the right to perform calculations across arrays.

Example: Numpy Library

``` python
# Importing Numpy package
import numpy as np

# Creating a 3-D numpy array using np.array()
org_array = np.array([[23, 46, 85],
                      [43, 56, 99],
                      [11, 34, 55]])

# Printing the Numpy array
print(org_array)
```

output
``` 
[[23 46 85]
 [43 56 99]
 [11 34 55]]
 ```
