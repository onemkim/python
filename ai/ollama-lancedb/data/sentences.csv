https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,434,Imagine picking up a nice juicy apple - but instead of biting into it you keep the seeds and throw the rest away. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,435,That's what chocolate producers have traditionally done with the cocoa fruit - used the beans and disposed of the rest. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,436,But now food scientists in Switzerland have come up with a way to make chocolate using the entire cocoa fruit rather than just the beans - and without using sugar. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,437,"The chocolate, developed at Zurich’s prestigious Federal Institute of Technology by scientist Kim Mishra and his team includes the cocoa fruit pulp, the juice, and the husk, or endocarp. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,438,The process has already attracted the attention of sustainable food companies. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,439,"They say traditional chocolate production, using only the beans, involves leaving the rest of the cocoa fruit – the size of a pumpkin and full of nutritious value -  to rot in the fields."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,440,"The key to the new chocolate lies in its very sweet juice, which tastes, Mr Mishra explains, ""very fruity, a bit like pineapple""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,441,"This juice, which is 14% sugar, is distilled down to form a highly concentrated syrup, combined with the pulp and then, taking sustainability to new levels, mixed with the dried husk, or endocarp, to form a very sweet cocoa gel. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,442,"The gel, when added to the cocoa beans to make chocolate, eliminates the need for refined sugar."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,443,Mr Mishra sees his invention as the latest in a long line of innovations by Swiss chocolate producers. 
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,444,"In the 19th Century, Rudolf Lindt, of the famous Lindt chocolate family, accidentally invented the crucial step of ""conching"" the chocolate – rolling the warm cocoa mass to make it smooth and reduce its acidity  – by leaving a cocoa mass mixer running overnight. The result in the morning? Deliciously smooth, sweet chocolate."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,446,"""You need to be innovative to maintain your product category,"" says Mr Mishra.  ""Or... you will just make average chocolate."""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,458,"Nowadays, the chocolate industry is much more highly regulated. Producers are supposed to monitor their entire supply chain to make sure there is no child labour. And, from next year, all chocolate imported to the European Union must guarantee that no deforestation took place to grow the cocoa used in it."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,459,"But does that mean all the problems are solved? Roger Wehrli, director of the association of Swiss chocolate manufacturers, Chocosuisse, says cases of child labour and deforestation remain, particularly in Africa. He fears that some producers, in a bid to avoid the challenges, are simply shifting their production to South America."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,460,"""Does this solve the problem in Africa? No. I guess it would be better for responsible firms to stay in Africa and help to improve the situation."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,461,"That is why Mr Wehrli sees the new chocolate developed in Zurich as ""very promising... If you use the whole cocoa fruit, you can get better prices. So it's economically interesting for the farmers. And it's interesting from an ecological point of view."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,463,"The link between chocolate production and the environment is also stressed by  Anian Schreiber. A third of all farm produce, he says, ""never ends up in our mouths""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,464,"Those statistics are even worse for cocoa, if the fruit is abandoned to use only the beans.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,465,"Food production involves significant greenhouse gas emissions, so reducing food waste could also help to tackle climate change.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,466,"But, back in the laboratory, key questions remain. How much will this new chocolate cost?"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,467,"And, most important of all, without refined sugar and only the cocoa fruit's own natural juice, which contains fruit sugar to keep it sweet, what does it really taste like?"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,468,"The answer to the last question, in this chocolate-loving correspondent’s view, is: surprisingly good. A rich, dark but sweet flavour, with a hint of cocoa bitterness that would fit perfectly with an after dinner coffee."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,469,"The cost may remain something of a challenge, because of the global power of the sugar industry, and the generous subsidies it receives. ""The cheapest ingredient in food will always be sugar as long as we subsidise it,"" explains Kim Mishra. ""For a... tonne of sugar, you pay $US500 [£394] or less."" Cocoa pulp and juice cost more, so the new chocolate would, for now, be more expensive."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47zg3xgxxo,Swiss chocolate: Scientists cut waste and sugar - BBC News,470,"Nevertheless, chocolate producers in countries where cocoa is grown, from Hawaii to Guatemala, to Ghana have contacted Mr Mishra for information about the new method. "

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,943,"But, thanks to the pandemic, demand for aircraft seats has flip-flopped dramatically of late. When Covid-19 emerged, the aerospace manufacturing industry slowed to a crawl. Globally, companies laid off thousands of workers. Thompson, for one, cut its own workforce in half, and has faced financial losses running to many millions."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,944,"The world has at last opened up again, but seat manufacturers have not been able to find all the skilled workers they need, meaning that demand, globally speaking, is outstripping supply. It is a “very difficult situation”, Airbus’ chief executive said in June, referring to the slow supply of seats and other cabin parts."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,945,"“The industry lost that expertise, both in terms of direct, hands-on manufacturing, but also in terms of teaching younger people how to do the job,” explains Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners who tracks the fortunes of another seat maker, Safran."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,946,"One of the problems, he adds, is that seat makers are finding it hard to get their seats tested and certified quickly by third-parties, since they are also facing labour shortages."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,947,"Thompson, however, can sidestep this problem with its in-house testing facilities, explains Colm McEvoy, vice president of corporate accounts. He says that the firm is able to meet its customers’ needs at present, though he adds, “We’re having to be very strategic with regards to the new customers.”"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,948,"There are more than 650 people working at Thompson’s sites in Northern Ireland, but, at the time of writing, the company had more than a dozen job vacancies listed on its website. “We’re in competition with other manufacturing companies to try and secure the best talent,” says Mr McEvoy."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,949,"Despite this challenge, Thompson has a five-year plan to multiply its annual output of seats. Mr McEvoy shows me around the factory floor at the firm’s Portadown site, where workers are busy riveting aluminium seat parts together, and checking the complex wiring for the entertainment systems in these expensive structures – each seat costs “tens of thousands” to make, says Mr McEvoy."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,950,"“This seat in front of you is the most complex seat we make,” adds Eoin Murray, operations manager. It takes around 100 hours for the highly skilled workers here to assemble in full."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,951,"Mr Murray is determined to boost the rate of production on this factory floor. He shows off a jig, developed in-house, upon which a seat can be mounted and angled so that workers can easily access the sides or underside. “This allows us to hit like a rate 14,” says Mr Murray – 14 seats produced in one shift. “I need to get to 18. To 20,” he adds."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,952,"To that end, there’s another even more capable version of the jig in the room next door, a prototype that staff here hope will be even better. Mr Murray and his colleagues are also developing new working practices – such as utility belts with tools arranged in the sequence they are required."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,953,"If the worker is left-handed, that sequence can be reversed so that the process of picking a tool and carrying out a task with it is as rapid as possible."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,954,"Workers here rehearse and hone key stages of seat assembly, which helps them go faster. A bit like learning how to build the same piece of Ikea furniture over and over again until it becomes like muscle memory, I suggest – just a lot more complicated."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,956,"Besides volume, there is constant pressure to come up with new and better seat designs, says Mr McEvoy. Airlines want the latest and best entertainment technology, for example – 32 inch screens are now included in Thompson’s top seats."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,957,"“They’re striving for something different, something that makes them unique,” Mr McEvoy adds. Thompson uses leather and soft fabrics on selected parts of the seat and enclosure to provide a luxury feel, which is increasingly popular with airlines. The seats themselves can recline into two-metre long, fully flat beds."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,958,"One I try for myself is certainly comfortable – though I would probably have to lie in it for seven hours or so to test it properly, I think to myself."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74l9p2x3dxo,How airline seats became key tech products - BBC News,959,"“They’re good firms, very, very good firms – they know what they’re doing,” says Marisa Garcia, an aviation industry analyst who used to work in seat manufacturing herself, referring to the Northern Ireland-based companies who make aircraft seats.
