Jiraiya, originally known as Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki, is the toad-riding protagonist of the Japanese folk tale Katakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari ("The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya"). The tale was originally a Yomihon that was published in 1806â€“1807, and was adapted into a serialized novel that was written by different authors and published in 43 installments from 1839 to 1868; one of its illustrators was woodblock artist Kunisada. Kawatake Mokuami then wrote a kabuki drama based on the first ten parts of the novel, which premiered in Edo in 1852, starring Ichikawa Danjuro VIII in the leading role. Since then the story has been adapted into, several films, video games, and manga and has also influenced various other works.
